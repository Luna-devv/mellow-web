**last modified 07/24/2025 (MM/DD/YYYY)**
<br />

These Payment Terms ("Terms") adheres to and encompasses the same definitions and entities as outlined in the Terms of Service.

# Premium Subscription
Wamellow Premium is a subscription-based service that enhances the user experience by providing upgraded features for individual Discord guilds (“guilds”, “servers”). These features are designed for advanced collaboration, management, and community growth.
<br /><br />
A detailed and current list of features included in Wamellow Premium is available at [wamellow.com/premium](https://wamellow.com/premium).

# Premium Subscription Pricing Model
Wamellow Premium is offered on a “Pay What You Want” basis, allowing you to choose the price you wish to pay for the service. However, there is a required minimum price for any subscription to be valid.
- **Minimum Price.** The minimum subscription price is €4.00 EUR (four Euros) per month.
- **Final Price.** You may choose to pay any amount equal to or greater than the minimum price.
<br /><br />
All payments for Wamellow Premium are due in advance of the service period. Subscriptions are billed on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or yearly), as selected by you during the purchase process.
<br /><br />
By providing a valid payment method (e.g., credit card), you expressly authorize Wamellow or its third-party payment processor to charge you for the subscription fee on a recurring basis. You agree to keep your payment information current and accurate.

# Refund Policy
**All purchases of Wamellow Premium are final and non-refundable.**
<br /><br />
Except as required by applicable law, we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, or unused services. We offer refunds only under the two limited circumstances outlined below:
* (1.) **Service Unavailability.** You may be eligible for a pro-rata refund for a given month if Wamellow's core services (defined as the availability of `wamellow.com`,`api.wamellow.com`, `tts.wamellow.com`) fall below a 99.0% uptime threshold during that calendar month, as measured by our internal monitoring systems ([status.wamellow.com](https://status.wamellow.com)). To be considered for a refund under this clause, you must submit a request to billing@wamellow.com within seven (7) days of the service interruption.
* (2.) **Confirmed Fraudulent Transactions.** If you believe a purchase was made on your account fraudulently, you must report it to us at billing@wamellow.com within five (5) business days of the transaction date. We will conduct an internal investigation into the claim. A refund will only be issued if our investigation, at our sole discretion, confirms that the transaction was fraudulent. We may require you to provide additional information or documentation to verify your identity and ownership of the payment method.
<br /><br />
All refunds will be issued only to the original billing method used for the purchase. No exceptions or alternative refund methods will be provided.

## Right of Withdrawal for Consumers in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA)
Under the EU Consumer Rights Directive, consumers typically have a 14-day right to withdraw from a purchase of digital content. However, this right can be waived for digital content that is delivered immediately.
<br /><br />
**By completing your purchase of a Wamellow Premium subscription, you expressly consent to the immediate supply of the digital content and services. You simultaneously acknowledge and agree that you thereby lose your statutory right of withdrawal.**
<br /><br />
Your access to Wamellow Premium features begins immediately upon successful payment, constituting the full performance of our service.

## Fair Use Policy
The term “unlimited” or “infinite,” when used in connection with our Premium features, refers to a high-volume capacity intended for normal guild operations. To ensure system stability and fair access for all users, “unlimited” or “infinite” features are subject to a practical limit of one thousand (1,000) items or more (e.g., custom commands, social notifications, etc) per guild.
<br /><br />
Usage exceeding this limit may be deemed a violation of this Fair Use Policy. Wamellow reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to throttle, suspend, or terminate access to the feature or, in cases of extreme abuse, the associated account.

# Chargebacks
We encourage you to contact our support team at billing@wamellow.com to resolve any billing discrepancies or issues before initiating a chargeback.
Initiating a chargeback with your bank or payment provider for a valid charge is a violation of these Terms. We reserve the right to immediately and permanently terminate any and all associated Wamellow accounts and active subscriptions upon receiving a chargeback notification. Terminated accounts will not be eligible for reinstatement.

# Changes to the Payment Terms
Wamellow reserves the right to modify these Payment Terms, including our pricing and refund policy, at any time. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any material changes. Your continued use of Premium services after such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
