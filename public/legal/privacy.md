## Security
We take the security of your information very seriously. When we collect your data, we make every effort to protect it from theft, loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, and use. We employ a variety of security measures to safeguard your information and ensure its confidentiality.

However, it is important to note that no electronic data transmission or storage is completely secure and absolute data security cannot be guaranteed. Despite our best efforts, there is always a risk of a data breach. In such an event, we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to protect your information and mitigate any potential harm.

It is also important for you to take responsibility for the security of your own data within our services. This includes choosing a strong and secure password and being mindful of the information you share with us.

Access to sensitive data is strictly limited to our chief developers. We have strict protocols in place to ensure that this data is never viewed, edited, shared or published without the express permission of the data creator. Our goal is to provide you with a secure and trustworthy service that respects your privacy and protects your information.

## Data Retention Period
We retain your personal data only for as long as it is necessary for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. The specific retention period will vary depending on the nature of the data and how it is used. When your personal data is no longer required, we will take steps to either delete it or anonymize it by removing any identifying details.

In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your personal data for longer periods in order to comply with legal, accounting or reporting obligations. This may also apply to data that is retained for archiving purposes in the public interest, or for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes.

We may collect or share personal data if we think someone’s life is in danger - for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation.

In the event that we become aware that an individual under the aforementioned age has provided us with personal information, we will take immediate and appropriate action to delete such information from our database in an irrevocable manner. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
