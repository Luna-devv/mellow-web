## Privacy Policy
**last modified 07/24/2025 (MM/DD/YYYY)**
<br />

This Privacy Policy adheres to and encompasses the same definitions and entities as outlined in the Terms of Service.

## Data Collection
Our database is designed to store a variety of information to enhance the user experience. This includes
* (1.) **Account Information.** When you connect your Discord account with Wamellow, we will store your unique Discord user ID and email address to facilitate communication and mitigate spam.
* (2.) **Content you create.** This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts, upload media such as emojis, avatars and banners, or post other content that you create with features that we develop.
* (3.) **Information from actions you take.** This includes information such as the Discord servers you own or manage and settings you choose.
* (4.) **Information from optional features.** Certain features, like the spotify music integration, may require that you provide additional information to make them work. This also includes third-party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third-party services to share with us.
* (5.) **Other information you provide directly to us.** You may have the option to submit additional information as you use Wamellow. For example, you may participate in surveys where you can provide feedback on the services, or submit information to our Wamellow Support teams.

## Payment Processing
To process payments, we use the third-party payment processor Stripe, Inc. Wamellow does not directly collect or store your full payment card details.
<br /><br />
When you provide payment information to purchase a subscription or perform a donation, you are providing it directly to Stripe. We only share the necessary information with Stripe to process your payment, prevent fraud, and manage your subscription or donation. This data may include:
* (1.) **Account Information.** Your email address and Discord user ID.
* (2.) **Transaction Information.** Transaction amount, type (e.g.: one-time payment, recurring payment), and date.
<br /><br />
All payment data is subject to the privacy policy of Stripe. As Stripe is a global company, your data may be transferred and processed in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Stripe uses legally-provided mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to ensure your data is protected.

## Cloudflare
We use services from Cloudflare, Inc. to protect and accelerate our website. This includes content delivery network (CDN), DDoS mitigation, and web security services. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable delivery of our online services (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
<br /><br />
* (1.) **Cloudflare Turnstile.** To protect our forms and login areas from spam and automated abuse, we also utilize Cloudflare Turnstile. This service verifies that a user is human without using traditional CAPTCHAs. In doing so, Turnstile may process personal data such as your IP address and certain browser and device characteristics. This processing is based on our overriding legitimate interest in protecting our systems from malicious bot activity (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
<br /><br />
As Cloudflare is a global company, your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States. Cloudflare has implemented safeguards to ensure that such data transfers comply with GDPR requirements.

## Security
We take the security of your information very seriously. When we collect your data, we make every effort to protect it from theft, loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, and use. We employ a variety of security measures to safeguard your information and ensure its confidentiality.
<br /><br />
However, it is important to note that no electronic data transmission or storage is completely secure and absolute data security cannot be guaranteed. Despite our best efforts, there is always a risk of a data breach. In such an event, we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to protect your information and mitigate any potential harm.
<br /><br />
It is also important for you to take responsibility for the security of your own data within our services. This includes choosing a strong and secure password and being mindful of the information you share with us.
<br /><br />
Access to sensitive data is strictly limited to our chief developers. We have strict protocols in place to ensure that this data is never viewed, edited, shared or published without the express permission of the data creator. Our goal is to provide you with a secure and trustworthy service that respects your privacy and protects your information.

## Data Retention Period
We retain your personal data only for as long as it is necessary for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. The specific retention period will vary depending on the nature of the data and how it is used. When your personal data is no longer required, we will take steps to either delete it or anonymize it by removing any identifying details.
<br /><br />
In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your personal data for longer periods in order to comply with legal, accounting or reporting obligations. This may also apply to data that is retained for archiving purposes in the public interest, or for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes.
<br /><br />
We may collect or share personal data if we think someone’s life is in danger - for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation.

## Children's Privacy and Data Collection
It is our policy to ensure that our Service is not directed towards children under the age of 13 and/or those who have not yet reached the applicable minimum age for providing digital consent in their respective country. As such, we do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals within this age group. In the event that we become aware that an individual under the aforementioned age has provided us with personal information, we will take immediate and appropriate action to delete such information from our database in an irrevocable manner. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
