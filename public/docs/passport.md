### üß® Punishment role

**Note:** This requires the failed verification action to be set to "Assign role to member".

### üí¨ Send direct message to member on fail

## Permissions
Here is a quick reference on how permissions should be setup so everything works as expected.

## Failure conditions
There are a few reasons why a member might fail verification. These may include but are not limited to:
- The captcha wasn't solved correctly for eight or more times.
- The user uses a disposable email address.
- The user uses a VPN or proxy. (experimental)
<br />
<br />

Once people have failed verification due to any reason, they will not be able to verify again at any time, and manual approval by server moderators or admins is required. Wamellow developers cannot verify or punish members in any server.
