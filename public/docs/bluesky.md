<br/>

Reacting with a *light blue ü©µ*-emoji to a message containing a Bluesky post for the first time will send you an authorization link via DMs. You don't have to create an app password or anything, just simply authorize Wamellow with your Bluesky account (uses oauth2).

## Setup
1. Add Wamellow to your server by going to [wamellow.com/add](https://wamellow.com/add).
2. Head to your connections by going to [wamellow.com/profile/connections](https://wamellow.com/profile/connections).
3. Click **Connect Bluesky** and follow the steps.
4. Reacting with a **ü©µ emoji** to any message containing a Bluesky post.

### üíª Does Wamellow have to be in the server?
Yes! You must [invite wamellow](https://wamellow.com/add) to the server and grand it 'View Channel' permission in every channel that you want to have that feature.

### ü§î Discord Direct Messages Disabled?
No worries! You can just go to [wamellow.com/profile/connections](https://wamellow.com/profile/connections) and link your Bluesky account with Wamellow manually.

### ü©µ Any heart emoji?
No, you must react with either a *light blue heart ü©µ-emoji* or with a *blue heart üíô-emoji*.

### üóÑÔ∏è I have my own PDS ('personal data server')!
Wamellow supports any PDS, no matter if it's a Bluesky mushroom, a Spark PDS, or your own. On the Wamellow DM or on [wamellow.com/profile/connections](https://wamellow.com/profile/connections), just click on **Connect 3rd-party PDS** and enter your Bluesky handle (like `shi.gg`), and follow the steps.
<br/>
<br/>

Though, expect minor issues, as this feature is still in testing. Any issues can be solved by just re-authorizing.
<br/>
<br/>

If you don't know what a PDS is, you don't have to worry about it anyway.

### üö® Does it work with Wamellow's Bluesky -> Discord notification?
Yes! [Bluesky notifications sent by Wamellow](https://dev.wamellow.com/docs/notifications) just have two additional buttons, a ü©µ-emoji button to like the post and a repost-emoji button to, well, repost the post..
