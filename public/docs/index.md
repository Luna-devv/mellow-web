## Funding
Wamellow is essentially a one-(wo)man show. I â€” [Luna](https://shi.gg) â€” plan, develop, maintain, host and fund the project alone, as I see it as a hobby and use programming is my form of therapy. I would be very grateful if you could support my work with a generous donation on [ko-fi.com/mwlica](https://ko-fi.com/mwlica) â€” but obviously there's no pressure!
